1.  **Go to your Google Business Profile:** Open Google Maps and search for your restaurant's name.
2.  **Find the "Get more reviews" button:** In your business profile panel, you should see a button that says "Get more reviews" or something similar. Click on it.
3.  **Copy the review link:** A pop-up will appear with a shareable link. This is your direct review link. Copy it to your clipboard. It should look something like this: `https://g.page/r/YourRestaurant/review`.

## Adding the Link to Your Profile
