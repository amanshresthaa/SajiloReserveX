# Research: Booking Validation Update

## Existing Patterns & Reuse

- Pending investigation.

## External Resources

- None yet.

## Constraints & Risks

- Build currently fails due to syntax errors in API route.

## Open Questions (and answers if resolved)

- Q: Are there existing validation services to reuse?
  A: Not yet reviewed.

## Recommended Direction (with rationale)

- Review recent changes in `src/app/api/bookings/[id]/route.ts` and align unified validation integration with TypeScript syntax.
