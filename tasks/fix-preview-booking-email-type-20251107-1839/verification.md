# Verification Report

## Automated Checks

- [x] `pnpm run lint`
  - ESLint/TypeScript tasks executed successfully.
- [x] `pnpm run build`
  - Full Next.js production build now completes without `GenericStringError` type failures.

## Notes

- UI is unaffected, so no Chrome DevTools MCP run was necessary.
