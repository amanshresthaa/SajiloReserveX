# Implementation Checklist

## UI/UX

- [x] Surface destructive alert in ops edit dialog when `BOOKING_IN_PAST` is returned
- [x] Customize toast copy for `BOOKING_IN_PAST` errors (guest + ops flows)
- [x] Mirror alert treatment in reservation wizard when `BOOKING_IN_PAST` is returned (customer flow)

## Notes

- Assumptions: custom customer-facing copy should stay aligned with toast wording for the same error
- Deviations: none

## Batched Questions (if any)

- None at this time
