# Post-Optimization Results Placeholder

This file will be populated after:
1. Feature flags FEATURE_AUTO_ASSIGN_RETRY_POLICY_V2 and PLANNER_CACHE_ENABLED are enabled in staging
2. Sufficient soak time (≥7 days) with stable traffic
3. Running post-optimization-query.sql against production database

## Expected Timeline
- Staging rollout: [TBD]
- Production gradual rollout: 10% → 50% → 100%
- Metrics collection window: 7 days at 100%
- Final comparison: [TBD]

## Monitoring Dashboards
- auto_assign.* events: [Dashboard URL TBD]
- Planner cache hit rate: [Dashboard URL TBD]
- Retry policy effectiveness: [Dashboard URL TBD]

## Success Criteria (from plan.md)
- [ ] `recordObservabilityEvent` receives a `auto_assign.quote` for every planner call
- [ ] Inline and job flows both log their events
- [ ] Baseline doc captures median/p95/p99 durations and retry counts

## Post-Optimization Targets
- ↓ p95/p99 attempts_used (from baseline)
- ↓ p95/p99 total_duration_ms (from baseline)
- ↑ skipped_initial_count (inline skip optimization working)
- Cache hit rate > 10% (if enabled and warmed)
