# Verification Report

## Manual QA — Chrome DevTools (MCP)

Blocked: `pnpm dev` could not start because another Next.js instance already holds `.next/dev/lock` (log shows process 8741 on port 3000). Documented so we can rerun QA once the shared dev server is available.

## Test Outcomes

- [x] `pnpm lint`

## Known Issues

- None observed yet.

## Sign-off

- [ ] Engineering
- [ ] Design/PM
