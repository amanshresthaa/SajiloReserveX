# Dashboard Accessibility Audit

## Scope

Assessed the authenticated dashboard experience (`app/(authed)/dashboard`) including the bookings table, filter controls, pagination, edit/cancel dialogs, and supporting UI primitives.

## Findings

1. **No skip link** — Global layout lacks a “Skip to content” affordance, violating the project requirement for keyboard navigation shortcuts.
2. **Insufficient tap target height on compact buttons** — `buttonVariants` `size="sm"` renders at 40px tall; filters and pagination controls use this size, falling short of the 44px mobile minimum.
3. **Touch ergonomics** — Buttons and links do not specify `touch-action: manipulation` or set a custom `-webkit-tap-highlight-color`, risking double‑tap zoom and inconsistent highlight contrast on mobile.
4. **Header CTA styling** — Dashboard header uses DaisyUI `btn` classes that do not inherit our focus ring/touch adjustments, leading to inconsistent focus visibility.
5. **Main landmark targeting** — Dashboard layout exposes `<main>` but without an `id`, preventing the planned skip link from targeting it.

## Recommended fixes

- Inject a global skip link in `app/layout.tsx` and mark dashboard main region with `id="main-content"` and `tabIndex={-1}`.
- Update `buttonVariants` to enforce ≥44px targets on all sizes, append `touch-manipulation`, and integrate `focus-visible` + `tap highlight` tuning via global CSS.
- Replace the header CTA link class with `buttonVariants` for consistent accessibility styling.
- Add CSS in `globals.css` to set `-webkit-tap-highlight-color` and `touch-action` defaults for interactive elements (anchors, buttons, form controls).

## Verification plan

- Keyboard navigation from top of page hits skip link, enters main, cycles through table filters, triggers dialogs, and returns focus to the invoking button when dialogs close.
- Use Playwright/axe to confirm no critical violations post-fix (aligned with Story E2 optional automation goal).
- Re-run vitest suites touching modified components.
