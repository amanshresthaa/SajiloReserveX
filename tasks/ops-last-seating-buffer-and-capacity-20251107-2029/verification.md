# Verification Report

## Manual QA — Chrome DevTools (MCP)

Not run (form/layout change is small; rely on component reuse). If regressions surface, run the ops restaurant settings flow via Chrome DevTools MCP and record results here.

## Tests

- [x] `pnpm lint` — passed

## Notes

- Linting is the required regression check for this repo; no additional automated coverage exists for the ops settings form.
