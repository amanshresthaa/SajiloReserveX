# TODO

- [x] Create migration adding contact fields to `public.restaurants` with sensible defaults.
- [x] Update `types/supabase.ts` restaurants definitions.
- [x] Refactor `server/emails/bookings.ts` to load venue details dynamically with fallback.
- [x] Re-run verification (`pnpm typecheck`) and log results.
