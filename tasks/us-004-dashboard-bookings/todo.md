# TODO — US-004 Dashboard Bookings Table

- [x] Draft Vitest specs for mobile bookings view + analytics events.
- [x] Split dashboard page into server prefetch wrapper + client component (React Query hydration).
- [x] Implement mobile card layout (incl. skeleton/empty states) and reuse formatting utilities.
- [x] Wire card actions to edit/cancel handlers; ensure analytics coverage.
- [x] Update `lib/analytics.ts` + tests if new events added.
- [x] Extend/author Playwright scenarios for guard redirect + cancel success flow.
- [ ] Run lint, typecheck, Vitest, and Playwright locally; document results.
- [ ] Accessibility/perf spot-check across breakpoints and update docs if needed.
