# TODO: Legacy Payments Cleanup

- [x] Remove Stripe API route directories and `libs/stripe.ts`.
- [x] Update configuration/types and delete pricing components/pages.
- [x] Drop Stripe-specific tests and OpenAPI documentation entries.
- [x] Prune env/docs references if present.
- [x] Run project checks and verify no stray Stripe references remain (code-level).
