# TODO: Customer Frontend Architecture (No Pricing/Stripe)

- [x] Update sprint planning docs to remove pricing/Stripe dependencies (`sprint-plan.md`, `sprint-2-plan.md`, `sprint-3-plan.md`).
- [x] Refresh IA, content, and routing artifacts without `/pricing` (JSON, content spec, routing TS, plan master doc).
- [x] Revise edge cases, analytics catalog, and acceptance tests to focus on reservation/auth flows.
- [x] Reconcile requirements analysis and final output package with new scope.
- [x] Document research insights and execution plan in `tasks/customer-flow-no-pricing/`.
- [x] Verify active specs free of pricing/Stripe references; note legacy payment stubs for future cleanup in research log.
