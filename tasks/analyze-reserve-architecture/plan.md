# Plan

1. Revisit the research notes to pinpoint the architectural touchpoints in `reserve/` that a reviewer must inspect (feature-sliced structure, cross-app aliases, data/API layer, state management, env configuration, testing).
2. Design the prompt structure: opening context, scope, expected depth, prioritized investigation areas, checklist of questions, and output format tailored to surfacing architectural pitfalls.
3. Draft the comprehensive prompt text, weaving in explicit directives to analyze coupling, ownership boundaries, data flow, configuration, testing, scalability, and risk hot-spots within the `reserve/` codebase.
4. Proofread and refine the prompt for clarity and completeness—ensure it is actionable, unambiguous, and emphasizes the architectural lens the user requested.
